## Coding conventions

### Git - branch naming

Branches should comply with: `xxx/pr-topic|jira-task` format, where `XXX` stands for:

- `imp` - improvement
- `dev` - developer's stuff (i.e. playing with dev tools, setting up stuff that is not noticeable by end-users)
- `feat` - feature
- `fix` - bug fixes
- `refactor` - refactoring

### Git - commit messages

Commit messages should include the following information in the respective lines (check out commitling config file for detailed information):

`commit 1`:

```
XXX(Main Topic): Brief description
* Details about some stuff
* More details about changes in a commit
```

`commit 2`:

```
